      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        I’m Mukthapuram Prasanthi, an enthusiastic IT graduate pursuing a B.Tech in Information Technology 
        at Sree Vidyanikethan Engineering College, Tirupati. I am passionate about building scalable applications, 
        exploring new technologies, and solving real-world problems through innovative solutions.

        I have gained hands-on experience through internships in Salesforce Development and Full Stack Web Development in slash mark, working with technologies like Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, MongoDB, and Apex.

        My academic projects include Improving Intrusion Detection Performance by Address Data Labelling and Imbalance Issues and creating a Dynamic Web Application with PHP and XAMPP. These experiences helped me strengthen my problem-solving and development skills.

        I’m eager to grow as a Full Stack Developer / Software Engineer, contribute to impactful projects, and continuously learn in the ever-evolving tech world.
